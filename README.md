Contents
data
The original dataset collected from an extensive literature survey.

imputed_data

pca_scores
Results from a phylogenetically corrected PCA used in downstream analyses.

dimensionality_reduction
Scripts for data preprocessing, imputation of missing data, and analysis (PCA and UMAP), including visualization.

phylosig_cor
